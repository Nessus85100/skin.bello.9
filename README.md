## F.A.Q
**Q: Where is my mouse pointer ?**
<br>**A:** Mouse usage is not supported in Bello and will never be. Please disable it from Settings > System > Input Devices > Enable mouse and touch screen support.

**Q: When installing, i get an error message saying "dependencies not met".**
<br>**A:** The cause for this is **always** one or more of the [required add-ons](#Required-Add-ons) or [supported add-ons](#Supported-Add-ons) not being installed on your system, or you're using a different (outdated) version of one or more of these add-ons. Go to Settings > Skin Settings > Supported Add-ons and make sure your add-ons are are installed and updated.

**Q: Help!... i dont see any Home Menu after first install. I only see the top menu in home screen**
<br>**A:** Bello's home menu it's builded (and it's fully customizable) with <a href="http://mirrors.xbmc.org/addons/nexus/script.skinshortcuts/">script.skinshortcuts</a> addon. If you dont see the home menu builded out-of-box, then something went wrong with the installation of the script.skinshortcuts addon. Use the "S" letter in your K/B to bring up the Power Menu and go to Settings > Skin Settings > Supported Add-ons to fix the problem. 

**Q: Can i play games using Bello 9 ?. Is there any support for this ?**
<br>**A:** No and will never be. Why ?... because Kodi is not a games console and as surprising as it sounds to some people... i don't play games in my PC!

**Q: I only see unwatched status indicators. Is there an option to display watched status indicators as well?**
**A:** No, there isn't and will never be. There is an indicator if the item is unwatched. If there is no indicator, the item is watched. I find this obvious and logical, and thus feel there is no added value in placing an indicator on files that have been watched. 

**Q: Can you add the X or Y feature ?**
<br>**A:** Mostly...not. As much as i hope people will enjoy using Bello 9, development is also driven by my own preferences. Apart from that, i just have no motivation to add features i wouldn't ever use myself and most importantly, my free time these days is very limited and it's unlikely to find more time besides some bug fixing.

**Q: Where is the X or Y feature from the old Bello versions ? Can you add it back?**
<br>**A:** Well...if is not there then mostly i've removed it either because i didn't like it anymore, or because wasn't fit with the new style of Bello 9. And no... i wont add it back.

**Q: It's been days that a i've posted a question/request/suggestion in the forum and still i don't have any answer. Are you ignoring me ?**
<br>**A:** Maybe yes, maybe not. Usually i'm pretty busy with other stuff outside of Kodi so any help or explanations they might be delay. So if you couldn't get any help from other users please be patient!. Also any requests or suggestions whom i don't agree or like will be ignored. Sorry guys, but i don't have the time to answer no & why to all of these stuff.

**Q: Where i can find support for this ?**
<br>**A:** [Bello 9 thread at Kodi.tv community forums.](https://forum.kodi.tv/forumdisplay.php?fid=198)
